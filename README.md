# mupen64plus-input-lua

Using this in conjunction with https://github.com/stump/n64io will allow you to use an N64 controller with mupen, along with all of its peripherals. Direct communication means rumble paks, controller paks, transfer paks, will just work without the need of some stupid expensive adapter.
